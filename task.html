            In the 2019 National and State election held in April and May 2019, YSR Congress Party swept the polls and won 151 of the total 175 assembly seats and 22 of the 25 Lok Sabha seats in Andhra Pradesh. 
            He took oath as the Chief Minister on 30 May 2019.
            His chief ministership has been marked by a slew of welfare schemes such as Jagananna Amma Vodi, Navaratnalu.
            Jagananna Amma Vodi provides financial assistance for mothers or guardians from the Below Poverty Line, to educate their children.
            Navaratnalu is a collection of nine welfare schemes covering farmers, women, medical and health, education, and Special Category Status.
            He scrapped the plans for a new capital at Amaravati, proposed by the former TDP government, and has proposed three different capitals for the judicial, administrative and legislative branches at Kurnool, Amaravati, and Visakhapatnam respectively.
            The proposal resulted in widespread protests by the farmers of Amaravati. The Andhra Pradesh High Court in a March 2022 ruling directed the Government of Andhra Pradesh to continue developing Amaravati and adjudicated that the government "lacked the competence to make any legislation for shifting, bifurcating or trifurcating the capital".
            As of April 2023, it was reported by the Association for Democratic Reforms that he was the richest Chief Minister in India, with total assets of 510 crore.
